# Choosing the topic
I think there are many coincidences in the process of choosing this topic with Yingyu. I was heavily influenced by Data Feminism; Chapter 1, Power Chapter. This article mentioned that the world's data on black female childbirth mortality is "particularly weak" At the same time, reading What Is Digital Humanities seemed to give me a sense of the power of data and digitalization, even though it was only a brief and concise sentence. As a member of a minority group in the U.S., although I can't help raising my voice like the famous tennis star Serena Williams and gain the resonance of the entire U.S. population, I firmly believe that I can still contribute to the weak database.
So I came across Yingyu's message on discord, and it was very similar to my idea that she, too, wanted to dig up some data about minorities and analyze it for research. I quickly got in touch with her and formed a group. I shared some of my personal ideas with her, including my knowledge and understanding of people with disability and accessibility design. After some discussions, we decided to use ADA as our primary research tool and decided on our topic.

# Process
Since my previous coding experience was almost 0, I was mainly responsible for mining some background information, data visualization, data analysis, and assisting Yingyu in data collection and coding during the whole process.

Before locking down the institution we were going to analyze, I was at a loss for a while because there are too many institutions in the world, and it is very unrealistic to scrape all the data in one semester through a web crawler. There is a sentence in Data Biographies: Getting to Know Your Data that is "Data Isn't Always Objective." My personal understanding of this sentence is that if you don't know what you want to analyze, your data may become biased. By reading this article, by asking ourselves the four questions on the reading (Where did it come from? Who collected it? How was it collected? Why was it collected?) we quickly determined our direction.

Yingyu and I targeted a few small organizations near our school during the development process. Because we weren't familiar with large institutions, at the same time, we didn't think it was unusual for a large, well-funded institution to have a beautiful website and a well-developed accessibility design. So we change our view to the smaller institutions in the Champaign-Urbana area, such as the official websites of the Spurlock Museum, the Krannert Museum, the Champaign Public Library, and the University Library, which we selected for this project. These are the institutions that we would regularly visit in our daily lives. We are very familiar with them and will arrive at more objective results.

In order to accurately evaluate these networks, we decided to use some quantitative evaluation criteria to make the results more objective and readable. In the end, we chose assessibe and Siteimprove to evaluate the websites in different dimensions. At the same time, Professor Leblanc recommended me a tool called internet archive to dig into the history of these websites. I hope to analyze the iterations of these websites to analyze the changing attitudes of people with disabilities and accessibility design.

# Experience
During the development process, I consider myself not only a developer but also a learner. I discovered a lot of data that already existed in Siteimprove about the history of websites and their updates and changes and visualized them. Most of these sites had undergone huge updates between 2012-2016. This allowed me to analyze this data and the associated human issues successfully.

During the integration and analysis of the data, I learned many coding-related lessons. For example, I learned to search Google to locate the right mods for the goals I wanted to achieve and other people who have encapsulated more code directly for other users to use directly. I also learned how to systematically learn a module that I had never touched before, first by searching YouTube for video tutorials on the subject. After having general knowledge, I would read the documentation of the module and try to do some experiments by myself.

We collected, analyzed, and visualized the data. Here are our [results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mE48Q-BETsKJWYIWK5S-gg2JsSemgEmD6CEuqSaWhb4/edit#slide=id.g1240c5d00c0_0_3).

We chose to use color blocks to represent the high and low scores. I noticed that in Data Organization in Spreadsheets, the author showed me Examples of spreadsheets with non-rectangular layouts. So I chose to build my chart with rectangular ones. Furthermore, I know that humans have been studying the humanities of color for over 100 years and that color creates a more immediate visual impact and makes data more readable than bar charts and pie charts. I hope that data visualization through color representation is a simple yet appropriate example of communication between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences. 
# Prospects
I really like the quote from The Network Turn. "We seek to open up a space for exchange between the humanities, arts, and sciences - a space that is genuinely collaborative, that is mutually beneficial, and that recognises that networks present a mode of inquiry that draws on knowledge and practices from all these domains. "As a communication student, I was very moved by this quote, which explains that humanities are not a discipline that does not progress with technology. It gives me hope that humanities will grow at a high rate through collaboration with computing. This statement will also stay in my memory forever in my future study.

For my plans, I hope I can learn to write more efficient code and evaluate the accessibility of previous versions of these sites. I hope to dig deeper into the history of the site to explore the social and human issues involved. Second, I would like to thank my professors at the School of Communication for recognizing my abilities. During the summer, I will be working with a research team. My main task is to crawl through the interviews of my fellow team members and frontline workers and quantify, analyze, and visualize the data on their mental states. I might have spent long hours reading through Excel tables in the past. But now I can use [text mining](https://github.com/CathyZhang1009/IS310_assignment/blob/main/text_mining.ipynb) functions to get the results I want in a very efficient way.
